# Overview

Our goal for this project is to create an enjoyable, but challenging, platformer game called DI Trying that follows the adventures of the main character, Dianna T., after crashing on an alien planet as she attempts to restore communications with home. We at Honey Badger Studios want to break the mold and provide players with a refreshing take on the classic platformer genre. With procedurally-generated paths that constantly shift as you explore, evolving enemies, and a class-based combat system, we hope to vastly increase the replayability of our game and reward the player for their ability to adapt to an ever-shifting environment.
